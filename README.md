# PContourNet
Ported from java to C# from https://github.com/LingDong-/PContour

### From original README:
Similar to OpenCV's `cv::findContours` and `cv::approxPolyDP`, the algorithms implement the following papers:
- Suzuki, S. and Abe, K., Topological Structural Analysis of Digitized Binary Images by Border Following
- David Douglas and Thomas Peucker, Algorithms for the reduction of the number of points required to represent a digitized line or its caricature
